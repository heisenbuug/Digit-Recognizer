### Competition Description

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

* Classification methods such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* sklearn

# I used Decision Tree Classifier which is included in Sklearn

A decision tree is a tree where each node represents a feature(attribute), each link(branch) represents a decision(rule) and each leaf represents an outcome(categorical or continues value).

The whole idea is to create a tree like this for the entire data and process a single outcome at every leaf(or minimize the error in every leaf).
